# House Prices (Kaggle Dataset)

## Quick Intro

This was my first regression project. This is a quite complete dataset, with lots of information and lots of data preprocessing to be done. Luckily for beginners like I was, there are some astounding notebooks uploaded on Kaggle that are very clear and understandable that allowed me to work on my analysis and data preprocessing technique, and practise my code structuring abilities. 

## Problem statement

In this analysis, we used data that describes several aspects of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, and tried to discover if the features provided allowed us to predict the price of the houses observed using a regression algorithm.  
 
## Approach

The dataset has several features that include: The size and shape of the terrain where the house is located, if it has garage/swimming pool, # of rooms, location, and many more. There are 79 variables total. 

In this analysis, there are several missing values that we had to address and some outliers that had to be analysed before moving on to the modeling. 

To model our data, we split our data into train and test to be able to verify that our model performs accordingly with new observations. We tried to predict our target variable (price of a house) with a regression algorithm. The algorithms used to model and fit our data were: Lasso, Ridge, ElasticNet, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, Gradient Boosting Regression. To quantify the models, the metrics used were: R2, MSE and MAE.  

## Quick Exploratory Data Analysis Summary


## Result

The best performing algorithm was the Ridge Regression algorithm: 0.9016 R2 and 0.5482 MSE.

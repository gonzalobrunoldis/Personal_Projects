## Index

This repository holds all of my personal projects that I've worked on since I started practising Data oriented journey. Currently they're binned in three different categories:

1. [SQL Projects]
2. [Dashboard creation + Reporting]
3. [Data processing + insight detection projects]
4. [Predictive Modeling - Classification & Regression ML Projects](https://github.com/gonzalobrunoldis/Personal_Projects/tree/main/00.%20Predictive%20Modeling)
    - [Predicting Discrete Variables - Classification Models](https://github.com/gonzalobrunoldis/Personal_Projects/tree/main/00.%20Predictive%20Modeling/Classification%20Models)
    - [Predicting Continuous Variables - Regression Models](https://github.com/gonzalobrunoldis/Personal_Projects/tree/main/00.%20Predictive%20Modeling/Regression%20Models)
    - [Discovering Hidden Patterns in Data (Segmentation Projects) - Clustering Models](https://github.com/gonzalobrunoldis/Personal_Projects/tree/main/00.%20Predictive%20Modeling/Clustering%20Models/Fifa%20Players)
5. [Deep Learning Projects (Work in progress)]()

Each category has their own variety of projects and should be accompanied by some form of documentation. 

## Background

Hello! 

My name is Gonzalo Brunoldi Stasiow and welcome to my Project Portfolio! Allow me to introduce myself. I did my undergraduate at Universidad de San Andr√©s (Argentina) where I majored in business management. Right after I finished my undergraduate studies I started working with data and was part of the helpdesk and maintenance of JD Edwards ERP, using SQL everyday to fix data issues that would prevent the company's ERP from working properly.

Later on I moved to consulting, and was a Management Consultant in Accenture, where I took part in several projects, focused on ERP implementation projects. While I was there, I was part of the Knowledge Sharing Crew of my consultancy branch, looking for international trends of new applications for popular technologies, such as Augmented Reality (AR), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and more, and presenting them to the team for them to apply that information on new projects.   

I am now transitioning to applied Data Science, and I am doing my personal projects on subjects that are relevant for me personally, and that will allow me to improve my coding and EDA skills.

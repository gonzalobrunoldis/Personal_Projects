Somos Holaluz y nacimos para hacer del mundo, un lugar mejor para todos. ¿Quieres saber cómo? En este vídeo te lo cuenta Carlota Pi, una de las tres fundadoras de Holaluz.
Tú y el planeta sois lo que nos mueve a ser como somos y a hacer lo que hacemos. Uno de nuestros principales valores es #AlwaysPeopleFirst. Por eso, te proponemos seguir creciendo en un entorno donde el #HaveFun y el #KeepRowing son imprescindibles, pero en el que puedas también desarrollarte 360º.

Nuestra voluntad de hacer las cosas de un modo distinto, nos ha llevado a liderar la transformación del sector eléctrico y a ser la primera eléctrica en obtener el certificado BCorp. En Holaluz:
No vendemos únicamente electricidad 100% de origen renovable, ofrecemos una relación a largo plazo con nuestros clientes basada en la confianza.
Gracias al uso de la tecnología, ofrecemos productos personalizados y tarifas que permiten ahorrar a las personas.
Convertimos los tejados en energía 100% verde.
Llevamos casi una década revolucionando el sector de la energía eléctrica. De hecho, estamos transformando los metros cuadrados de los tejados de nuestras ciudades y pueblos en energía 100% verde para todos. Y lo hemos llamado la Revolución de los Tejados.
Nuestra misión no es otra que conectar a todas las personas a la energía 100% verde y no pararemos hasta conseguirlo.
¿Te sumas?

¿Qué harás?
El foco del día a día está puesto en dar soporte a todo el equipo de ventas, por un lado creando herramientas que automaticen, agilicen y mejoren las principales tareas del equipo y por otro lado analizando en profundidad multitud de datos para convertir estos datos en información valiosa que ayude al equipo a tomar las mejores decisiones.
Estamos buscando un analista de datos que tenga una visión amplia de negocio.
Como analista estratégico tienes que combinar los conocimientos de programación con
los conocimientos de negocio para poder proporcionar las mejores soluciones de la forma más holística y rigurosa posible.
El equipo de sales data es un equipo pequeño con el que ejecutarás proyectos end-to-end, desde analizar cuáles son las posibles errores o potenciales mejoras, diseñar posibles soluciones y llevarlas a cabo programándolas. Tendrás total libertad para decidir cómo hacer las cosas de la mejor manera posible, ¡estamos deseando escuchar tus propuestas!
Tus principales responsabilidades serán:
Liderar proyectos que convierten datos en valor para Holaluz.
Creación y mantenimiento de procesos ETL para tener actualizado nuestro ""Data Lake"" y ""Data Warehouse"".
Creación de informes de BI para seguir métricas y KPI de ventas.
Dar soporte a todo el equipo de ventas con todo lo relacionado con los datos.
Construir herramientas y soluciones para hacer la vida más fácil a nuestros compañeros de equipo de ventas
Creación, optimización y mantenimiento de herramientas automatizadas (Simuladores de facturas, generadores de ofertas, etc.)
Automatizar tareas recurrentes del equipo
Pensar en nuevas fuentes de datos que contribuyan al crecimiento y la eficiencia de Holaluz.
Participar en las reuniones de pricing con los equipos de Gross Margin y Gestión de la energía.
Y como #SayThingsAsTheyAre es uno de nuestro valores, queremos ser claros y transparentes en explicarte qué harás durante tus primeros 6 meses en Holaluz.

En 1 mes...
Después del primer mes ya sabrás cómo está todo montado, te habrás empapado de nuestra cultura y tendrás una visión más clara de tus metas.
Seguramente habrás ido a comer algún viernes con las personas del equipo, habrás asistido a alguna formación del sector y alguna reunión de pricing.
Habrás solucionado algún error y habrás creado tu primer informe.
En 3 meses...

Seguro que ya habrás tomado muchas decisiones sobre cómo aportar valor a tu equipo y estarás trabajando codo a codo con tus colegas, en otras palabras, habrás visto la LUZ.
Habrás disfrutado de algún team building con el equipo y empezarás a dominar nuestras bases de datos, ¡SQL será tu segunda lengua!
En 6 meses...
Tendrás (casi) todo bajo control y habrás contribuido en la madurez y crecimiento de tu equipo de ventas. Habrás aprendido mucho y empezarás a dominar todas las herramientas.
Además, habrás tenido varias reuniones con tu responsable para saber cómo te sientes en tus primeros meses con Holaluz.

¿Cómo lo harás?
Otro de nuestros valores es #KeepRowing o seguir remando, lo que significa que el trabajo en equipo y la alineación del mismo es fundamental para poder avanzar y hacer frente a nuestros objetivos compartidos.
En Holaluz hemos construido un sistema organizativo robusto y en constante iteración, que permite adaptarnos a los cambios constantes que exige el sector y a conseguir el propósito que perseguimos, utilizando diversas metodologías, entre ellas SCRUM. En Holaluz las reuniones y decisiones se hacen de forma colaborativa, el feedback fluye entre los diferentes equipos y se promueve el apoyo entre las personas.

¿Con quién lo harás?
#AlwaysPeopleFirst y #HaveFun son también valores muy importantes en Holaluz, y para pasárselo bien es importante tener un buen equipo de trabajo, por eso te presentamos a las personas con las que trabajarás en tu día a día.
En el equipo de sales data trabajarás juntamente con Marwa, que de momento es la única integrante del equipo de datos. Pero también estarás trabajando codo a codo con Blanca que se encarga de tener controlado el Gross Margin de la compañía, con Lluc y el equipo de Sales OPS que están siempre pendientes de atender a nuestro canal comercial. También ayudarás a Karel y su equipo para seguir aumentando las ventas de nuestros canales comerciales y al equipo de Oriol con las ventas directas. Y por supuesto, también con María que dirige todo el equipo comercial.

¿Dónde lo harás?
Otra forma de #KeepRowing es remar todos juntos en perfecta sincronización y hacia un objetivo común, y qué mejor lugar para hacerlo que en nuestras oficinas de Barcelona a sólo 200 metros del mar . Esta excepcional ubicación al lado de la playa es perfecta para hacer un break con chapuzón y poder poner en práctica otro de nuestros valores #HaveFun.

Somos Holaluz y nacimos para hacer del mundo, un lugar mejor para todos. ¿Quieres saber cómo? En este vídeo te lo cuenta Carlota Pi, una de las tres fundadoras de Holaluz.
Tú y el planeta sois lo que nos mueve a ser como somos y a hacer lo que hacemos. Uno de nuestros principales valores es #AlwaysPeopleFirst. Por eso, te proponemos seguir creciendo en un entorno donde el #HaveFun y el #KeepRowing son imprescindibles, pero en el que puedas también desarrollarte 360º.

Nuestra voluntad de hacer las cosas de un modo distinto, nos ha llevado a liderar la transformación del sector eléctrico y a ser la primera eléctrica en obtener el certificado BCorp. En Holaluz:
No vendemos únicamente electricidad 100% de origen renovable, ofrecemos una relación a largo plazo con nuestros clientes basada en la confianza.
Gracias al uso de la tecnología, ofrecemos productos personalizados y tarifas que permiten ahorrar a las personas.
Convertimos los tejados en energía 100% verde.
Llevamos casi una década revolucionando el sector de la energía eléctrica. De hecho, estamos transformando los metros cuadrados de los tejados de nuestras ciudades y pueblos en energía 100% verde para todos. Y lo hemos llamado la Revolución de los Tejados.
Nuestra misión no es otra que conectar a todas las personas a la energía 100% verde y no pararemos hasta conseguirlo.
¿Te sumas?

¿Qué harás?
El foco del día a día está puesto en dar soporte a todo el equipo de ventas, por un lado creando herramientas que automaticen, agilicen y mejoren las principales tareas del equipo y por otro lado analizando en profundidad multitud de datos para convertir estos datos en información valiosa que ayude al equipo a tomar las mejores decisiones.
Estamos buscando un analista de datos que tenga una visión amplia de negocio.
Como analista estratégico tienes que combinar los conocimientos de programación con
los conocimientos de negocio para poder proporcionar las mejores soluciones de la forma más holística y rigurosa posible.
El equipo de sales data es un equipo pequeño con el que ejecutarás proyectos end-to-end, desde analizar cuáles son las posibles errores o potenciales mejoras, diseñar posibles soluciones y llevarlas a cabo programándolas. Tendrás total libertad para decidir cómo hacer las cosas de la mejor manera posible, ¡estamos deseando escuchar tus propuestas!
Tus principales responsabilidades serán:
Liderar proyectos que convierten datos en valor para Holaluz.
Creación y mantenimiento de procesos ETL para tener actualizado nuestro ""Data Lake"" y ""Data Warehouse"".
Creación de informes de BI para seguir métricas y KPI de ventas.
Dar soporte a todo el equipo de ventas con todo lo relacionado con los datos.
Construir herramientas y soluciones para hacer la vida más fácil a nuestros compañeros de equipo de ventas
Creación, optimización y mantenimiento de herramientas automatizadas (Simuladores de facturas, generadores de ofertas, etc.)
Automatizar tareas recurrentes del equipo
Pensar en nuevas fuentes de datos que contribuyan al crecimiento y la eficiencia de Holaluz.
Participar en las reuniones de pricing con los equipos de Gross Margin y Gestión de la energía.
Y como #SayThingsAsTheyAre es uno de nuestro valores, queremos ser claros y transparentes en explicarte qué harás durante tus primeros 6 meses en Holaluz.

En 1 mes...
Después del primer mes ya sabrás cómo está todo montado, te habrás empapado de nuestra cultura y tendrás una visión más clara de tus metas.
Seguramente habrás ido a comer algún viernes con las personas del equipo, habrás asistido a alguna formación del sector y alguna reunión de pricing.
Habrás solucionado algún error y habrás creado tu primer informe.
En 3 meses...

Seguro que ya habrás tomado muchas decisiones sobre cómo aportar valor a tu equipo y estarás trabajando codo a codo con tus colegas, en otras palabras, habrás visto la LUZ.
Habrás disfrutado de algún team building con el equipo y empezarás a dominar nuestras bases de datos, ¡SQL será tu segunda lengua!
En 6 meses...
Tendrás (casi) todo bajo control y habrás contribuido en la madurez y crecimiento de tu equipo de ventas. Habrás aprendido mucho y empezarás a dominar todas las herramientas.
Además, habrás tenido varias reuniones con tu responsable para saber cómo te sientes en tus primeros meses con Holaluz.

¿Cómo lo harás?
Otro de nuestros valores es #KeepRowing o seguir remando, lo que significa que el trabajo en equipo y la alineación del mismo es fundamental para poder avanzar y hacer frente a nuestros objetivos compartidos.
En Holaluz hemos construido un sistema organizativo robusto y en constante iteración, que permite adaptarnos a los cambios constantes que exige el sector y a conseguir el propósito que perseguimos, utilizando diversas metodologías, entre ellas SCRUM. En Holaluz las reuniones y decisiones se hacen de forma colaborativa, el feedback fluye entre los diferentes equipos y se promueve el apoyo entre las personas.

¿Con quién lo harás?
#AlwaysPeopleFirst y #HaveFun son también valores muy importantes en Holaluz, y para pasárselo bien es importante tener un buen equipo de trabajo, por eso te presentamos a las personas con las que trabajarás en tu día a día.
En el equipo de sales data trabajarás juntamente con Marwa, que de momento es la única integrante del equipo de datos. Pero también estarás trabajando codo a codo con Blanca que se encarga de tener controlado el Gross Margin de la compañía, con Lluc y el equipo de Sales OPS que están siempre pendientes de atender a nuestro canal comercial. También ayudarás a Karel y su equipo para seguir aumentando las ventas de nuestros canales comerciales y al equipo de Oriol con las ventas directas. Y por supuesto, también con María que dirige todo el equipo comercial.

¿Dónde lo harás?
Otra forma de #KeepRowing es remar todos juntos en perfecta sincronización y hacia un objetivo común, y qué mejor lugar para hacerlo que en nuestras oficinas de Barcelona a sólo 200 metros del mar . Esta excepcional ubicación al lado de la playa es perfecta para hacer un break con chapuzón y poder poner en práctica otro de nuestros valores #HaveFun.

Aug 31, 2021
Description:
The Centro Nacional de Análisis Genómico (CNAG-CRG) is one of the largest Genome Sequencing Centers in Europe. CNAG-CRG researchers participate in major International Genomic Initiatives such as the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC), the International Human Epigenome Consortium (IHEC), the International Rare Diseases Research Consortium (IRDiRC) and the European Infrastructure for life-science information (ELIXIR), as well as in several EU-funded projects.

It is integrated with the Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG), an international biomedical research institute of excellence, based in Barcelona, Spain, with more than 400 scientists from 44 countries. The CRG is composed by an interdisciplinary, motivated and creative scientific team which is supported both by a flexible and efficient administration and by high-end and innovative technologies.

In April 2021, the Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG) received the renewal of the 'HR Excellence in Research' logo from the European Commission. This is a recognition of the Institute's commitment to developing an HR Strategy for Researchers, designed to bring the practices and procedures in line with the principles of the European Charter for Researchers and the Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers (Charter and Code).

Please, check out the CRG's Recruitment Policy

The role

We have an opening for a Bioinformatics Analyst through the EU-funded 3TR project. The 3TR consortium sets out to increase our knowledge of the molecular pathways and mechanisms linked to response and non-response to therapy in seven different immune-mediated, allergic and inflammatory diseases. In line with this, the candidate will perform integrative omic analysis on bulk RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, miRNA-seq and methylation data to identify regulatory commonalities across the diseases. Other topics for the Bioinformatics Analyst include advice on experimental design and development and support of bioinformatics workflows for tailored analysis of other collaborative projects and interpretation of ongoing biology.

About the team

The successful candidate will be integrated into the 3TR project of the Biomedical Genomics Group led by Dr. Ivo Gut and will work with Dr. Anna Esteve of the Functional Genomics Team. Dr. Ivo Gut is the CNAG-CRG director and head of the Biomedical Genomics group. He coordinates the BCLLatlas project and the European Advanced Sequencing Infrastructure project (EASI-Genomics), funded by the European Commission. Dr. Ivo Gut participates in H2020 projects B-CAST, SPIDIA-4P, ELIXIR-EXCELERATE, SOLVE-RD, EJP-RD and EuCanCan. In addition, the CNAG-CRG participates in major Spanish initiatives in Personalized Medicine such as the PERIS projects MedPERCAN and URDCat, the 1,000 Catalan Genomes project, and the Navarra project on personalized medicine.

The Biomedical Genomics Group focusses on furthering the understanding of diseases using different types of genomic data, novel statistical approaches and bioinformatics. Big data approaches are used to identify patterns on genome, transcriptome and epigenome level that correlate with a disease and the evolution across the course of the disease. The objective is to answer questions that go beyond the initial hypotheses that underlay the studies to shed light on how genome sequence, structure and usage relates to disease, disease initiation, disease progression and disease mechanisms. The group also studies genomic features related to disease at different cellular levels. The disease areas range from rare to common disorders including cancer.

We can all do our part in fighting food waste and do our bit to tackle climate change by reducing the amount of food wasted. Did you know that a third of all food produced gets thrown away? This unnecessary food waste equates to 8% of greenhouse gas emissions!

Too Good To Go is a food waste-fighting app and a certified B Corporation. We connect stores that have unsold, surplus food with consumers who buy and enjoy it. We save two meals every second, all thanks to our 2+ million daily users. We have over 43 million registered app users in 16 locations across Europe, the US and North America. Together, we have saved more than 87 million meals from going to waste. We are super proud of this, but there is still lots more that we want to achieve.


This role can be based either from Copenhagen HQ or in our Madrid office as part of our new tech hub.


Too Good To Go is looking for a new Data Engineer to further enhance our existing data infrastructure. You will be a part of our platform team, working in a closely knit organisation, collaborating extensively with other Engineers, Data Scientists, and Analysts from many other teams.

Your mission will be building the infrastructure to make data insights widely available - both internally for our business critical use cases, but also externally to enhance the use of data insights in our mobile and web applications. What you help build will be used daily by our millions of users, our partners and our internal business stakeholders.

The role

You will be developing and maintaining our data infrastructure, using primarily AWS services, including data ingestion/export tools and our data warehouse. You will build and improve our CI/CD and monitoring systems, as well as support our analysts and analytics engineers in building efficient and scalable data pipelines.

You get to bring your own opinions and experience when it comes to the technology stack. We've kept the legacy systems to a minimum, so there is room to adapt and optimize.

Requirements

1+ years of experience within a similar role
You are technically curious, pragmatic and a self starter.
You have a background in building scalable and data-intensive applications, ideally on cloud infrastructure. If you haven't been called a Data Engineer before, your title might have been along the lines of Software Engineer, Site Reliability Engineer or similar.
You are familiar with modern Python
You are fluent in SQL and you understand the internals of modern data warehouses (ideally Redshift)

Nice to have

Knowledge of CI/CD tools, Docker (ideally on Kubernetes) and/or Terraform
You have worked with Airflow
Experience applying DevOps principles to data systems (DataOps)
Some exposure to ML platforms.
Kafka / KStreams / event stream processing.

Our values

We fight together: food waste is a big beast to fight. We can do it if we fight together as Waste Warriors with no ego. We believe in a #oneteam.
We raise the bar: we always push for more. We work smart, smash barriers and elevate one another.
We keep it simple: our ambitions are bold but our solutions are simple
We build a legacy: we're proud of the change we're driving.
We care: we always look out for each other. Caring is also about the way we do business. We do the right thing.

What We Have To Offer

A rare opportunity to work in a social impact company (and certified B Corporation!) where you get to wake up every day knowing you're achieving positive change.
The experience of being part of an international company with 1200 + enthusiastic and highly talented teammates across 16 countries (and counting) – always ready to share knowledge and support!
Strong personal as well as professional development in an intense and high-growth scale-up environment.
An open company culture where you have the independence and room to unleash your creativity.
A strong team culture where successes are celebrated together.

How To Apply

We take recruitment very seriously, so please carefully read everything we have written above. Please also check our website and international media in order to get a good overview of Too Good To Go.
Submit your CV and Cover letter in English.
Please note that we only accept applications coming through our platform. No CV or Cover Letter will be accepted by email or LinkedIn direct messaging.

A Movement for Everyone
We want to inspire and empower everyone to fight food waste together. With that mission, it's only natural that we want to build a diverse and inclusive team of highly capable individuals who are passionate about doing things in a better way. We strongly believe we all excel and are more creative when we're allowed to be ourselves, and we're committed to a culture where all of us belong.
We are an equal opportunity employer and all employment is decided on the basis of qualifications, merit and business need. If you need reasonable accommodation at any point in the application or interview process, please let us know."

We can all do our part in fighting food waste and do our bit to tackle climate change by reducing the amount of food wasted. Did you know that a third of all food produced gets thrown away? This unnecessary food waste equates to 8% of greenhouse gas emissions!

Too Good To Go is a food waste-fighting app and a certified B Corporation. We connect stores that have unsold, surplus food with consumers who buy and enjoy it. We save two meals every second, all thanks to our 2+ million daily users. We have over 43 million registered app users in 16 locations across Europe, the US and North America. Together, we have saved more than 87 million meals from going to waste. We are super proud of this, but there is still lots more that we want to achieve.


This role can be based either from Copenhagen HQ or in our Madrid office as part of our new tech hub.


Too Good To Go is looking for a new Senior Data Engineer to further enhance our existing data infrastructure. You will be part of the Platform team in a closely knit organisation, collaborating extensively with other Engineers, Data Scientists, and Analysts from many other teams.

Your mission will be building the infrastructure to make data insights widely available - both internally for our business critical use cases, but also externally to enhance the use of data insights in our mobile and web applications. What you help build will be used daily by our millions of users, our partners and our internal business stakeholders.

The role

You will be developing and maintaining our data infrastructure, using primarily AWS services, including data ingestion/export tools and our data warehouse. You will build and improve our CI/CD and monitoring systems, as well as support our analysts and analytics engineers in building efficient and scalable data pipelines.

You get to bring your own opinions and experience when it comes to the technology stack. We've kept the legacy systems to a minimum, so there is room to adapt and optimize.

Requirements

You are technically curious, pragmatic and a self starter.
You have a background in building scalable and data-intensive applications, ideally on cloud infrastructure. If you haven't been called a Data Engineer before, your title might have been along the lines of Software Engineer, Site Reliability Engineer or similar.
You are familiar with modern Python
You are fluent in SQL and you understand the internals of modern data warehouses (ideally Redshift)
Experience with CI/CD tools, Docker (ideally on Kubernetes) and Terraform
You have worked with Airflow

Nice to have

Experience applying DevOps principles to data systems (DataOps)
Some exposure to ML platforms.
Kafka / KStreams / event stream processing.

Our values

We fight together: food waste is a big beast to fight. We can do it if we fight together as Waste Warriors with no ego. We believe in a #oneteam.
We raise the bar: we always push for more. We work smart, smash barriers, and elevate one another.
We keep it simple: our ambitions are bold but our solutions are simple
We build a legacy: we're proud of the change we're driving.
We care: we always look out for each other. Caring is also about the way we do business. We do the right thing.

What We Have To Offer

A rare opportunity to work in a social impact company (and certified B Corporation!) where you get to wake up every day knowing you're achieving positive change.
The experience of being part of an international company with 1200 + enthusiastic and highly talented teammates across 16 countries (and counting) – always ready to share knowledge and support!
Strong personal as well as professional development in an intense and high-growth scale-up environment.
An open company culture where you have the independence and room to unleash your creativity.
A strong team culture where successes are celebrated together.


How To Apply

We take recruitment very seriously, so please carefully read everything we have written above. Please also check our website and international media in order to get a good overview of Too Good To Go.
Submit your CV and Cover letter in English.
Please note that we only accept applications coming through our platform. No CV or Cover Letter will be accepted by email or LinkedIn direct messaging.
A Movement for Everyone
We want to inspire and empower everyone to fight food waste together. With that mission, it's only natural that we want to build a diverse and inclusive team of highly capable individuals who are passionate about doing things in a better way. We strongly believe we all excel and are more creative when we're allowed to be ourselves, and we're committed to a culture where all of us belong.
We are an equal opportunity employer and all employment is decided on the basis of qualifications, merit and business need. If you need reasonable accommodation at any point in the application or interview process, please let us know."

Senior Data Engineer",Too Good To Go,"Madrid, Madrid provincia",8/20/2021,https://es.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=a60a08554498b00d&fccid=8568b3938fc8c53f&vjs=3,NA,NA,NA,"At Too Good To Go, we dream of a planet with no food waste.

We can all do our part in fighting food waste and do our bit to tackle climate change by reducing the amount of food wasted. Did you know that a third of all food produced gets thrown away? This unnecessary food waste equates to 8% of greenhouse gas emissions!

Too Good To Go is a food waste-fighting app and a certified B Corporation. We connect stores that have unsold, surplus food with consumers who buy and enjoy it. We save two meals every second, all thanks to our 2+ million daily users. We have over 43 million registered app users in 16 locations across Europe, the US and North America. Together, we have saved more than 87 million meals from going to waste. We are super proud of this, but there is still lots more that we want to achieve.


This role can be based either from Copenhagen HQ or in our Madrid office as part of our new tech hub.


Too Good To Go is looking for a new Senior Data Engineer to further enhance our existing data infrastructure. You will be part of the Platform team in a closely knit organisation, collaborating extensively with other Engineers, Data Scientists, and Analysts from many other teams.

Your mission will be building the infrastructure to make data insights widely available - both internally for our business critical use cases, but also externally to enhance the use of data insights in our mobile and web applications. What you help build will be used daily by our millions of users, our partners and our internal business stakeholders.

The role

You will be developing and maintaining our data infrastructure, using primarily AWS services, including data ingestion/export tools and our data warehouse. You will build and improve our CI/CD and monitoring systems, as well as support our analysts and analytics engineers in building efficient and scalable data pipelines.

You get to bring your own opinions and experience when it comes to the technology stack. We've kept the legacy systems to a minimum, so there is room to adapt and optimize.

Requirements

You are technically curious, pragmatic and a self starter.
You have a background in building scalable and data-intensive applications, ideally on cloud infrastructure. If you haven't been called a Data Engineer before, your title might have been along the lines of Software Engineer, Site Reliability Engineer or similar.
You are familiar with modern Python
You are fluent in SQL and you understand the internals of modern data warehouses (ideally Redshift)
Experience with CI/CD tools, Docker (ideally on Kubernetes) and Terraform
You have worked with Airflow

Nice to have

Experience applying DevOps principles to data systems (DataOps)
Some exposure to ML platforms.
Kafka / KStreams / event stream processing.

Our values

We fight together: food waste is a big beast to fight. We can do it if we fight together as Waste Warriors with no ego. We believe in a #oneteam.
We raise the bar: we always push for more. We work smart, smash barriers, and elevate one another.
We keep it simple: our ambitions are bold but our solutions are simple
We build a legacy: we're proud of the change we're driving.
We care: we always look out for each other. Caring is also about the way we do business. We do the right thing.

What We Have To Offer

A rare opportunity to work in a social impact company (and certified B Corporation!) where you get to wake up every day knowing you're achieving positive change.
The experience of being part of an international company with 1200 + enthusiastic and highly talented teammates across 16 countries (and counting) – always ready to share knowledge and support!
Strong personal as well as professional development in an intense and high-growth scale-up environment.
An open company culture where you have the independence and room to unleash your creativity.
A strong team culture where successes are celebrated together.

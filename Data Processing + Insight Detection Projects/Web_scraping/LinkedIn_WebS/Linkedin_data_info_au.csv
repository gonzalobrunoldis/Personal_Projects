Full-time",Entry level,"A Bit About Us  Gamers spent more than $100 billion on in-game items last year. However, $0 of that went to other players – it went directly to huge free-to-play game studios. Until now, games have only sold licences for these in-game items with highly restricted rights. At Immutable, we're all about ownership: using blockchain technology to give players true and ""immutable"" ownership over the items they've worked so hard to acquire. Meaning they can trade, sell and utilise their digital items as they see fit. Alongside games, we build marketplaces and tools for these assets so that game developers can build fully-fledged economies within their games.  As a Full Stack Software Engineer, you will work in an elite team focused on taking our flagship game asset exchange ""Immutable X"" to as many players and gamers as possible. You'll help them build innovative growth features and incentive schemes to maximise this expansion. You'll have a lot of flexibility in terms of tools, technology and architecture: most of your goals will be product-driven rather than tech-driven.  You will be an active engineer on that team, personally working on both frontend and backend features, but you will also be involved in product design and development. You'll help the team estimate, prioritise and scope features, and contribute to product discussions at all stages of development.  If you're looking to work on a fun and iterative product, in a strong team, with a great deal of independence, this role is for you.    We do need to you be able to work with our pre-existing stack:  It's desirable but not necessary for you to have blockchain development experience or developed application interfaces with blockchain. As long as you are willing to learn, then we can train you on this.                    Immutable is committed to building and fostering an inclusive, diverse workplace. We believe in incorporating everyone’s perspectives and experiences as this has been a significant driver in our success so far.  For this reason, we strongly encourage candidates of all backgrounds to get in touch. Even if you don’t meet all the requirements of a job listing, do yourself (and us) a favour by still applying! It’s highly likely you’ll bring something to the workplace that we haven’t thought of yet, and we would love to hear from you."

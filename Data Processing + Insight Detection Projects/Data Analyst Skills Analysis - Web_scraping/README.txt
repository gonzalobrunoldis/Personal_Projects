In this project my aim was to do two things:
1- Learn and apply web scraping on a real use case
2- Gain insights over the scraped data and with it guide my future education

I wanted to know what to focus my learning efforts on, which is why I simply decided that -as a data-oriented person- what would be better than creating my own dataset and figure out what interested me the most: What skills are being fetched the most by employers?

The job postings were scraped from the following websites:
- Glassdoor
- LinkedIn
- Seek
- Indeed

In this folder you will be able to see the scrapers for each of the websites (inside of each folder) as well as the processing of the job postings clustered per country (See Australian_Job_Analysis, Spanish_Job_Analysis and US_Job_Analysis), and the CSVs with the analyzed results (See the folder 'Results - CSV').

DISCLAIMER: All the scraped information was PUBLICLY available, no private information was scraped.

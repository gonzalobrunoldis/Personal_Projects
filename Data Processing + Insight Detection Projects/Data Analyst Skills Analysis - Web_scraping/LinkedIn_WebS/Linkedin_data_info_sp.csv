Full-time",Entry level,"The shift towards self-serve analytics means that in many companies, virtually everyone (from support agent to CEO) is directly consuming data. It has fallen on the data engineers to keep these new (and demanding) data ‚Äòcustomers‚Äô satisfied, providing the infrastructure that delivers actionable insights from raw data.  Data engineers report being continually bombarded with queries via Slack; when a BI dashboard breaks, a metric seems ‚Äòoff ', a table is missing data, a user requires access to a dataset, to name a few. Prioritising these ad-hoc tasks on the fly, alongside their core responsibilities, without compromising on security and privacy, is no walk in the park.  Alvin is a DataOps tool that acts as a data engineer‚Äôs co-pilot; giving them the context they need to make better decisions faster. Alvin‚Äôs core data lineage technology integrates with the modern data stack and automatically builds and maintains a real time data structure that maps dependencies between columns, tables, dashboards, jobs and people.  This dataset powers use cases such as impact analysis (can I delete this column?), problem tracing (why did this dashboard break?) and usage analytics (is anyone using this table?). We‚Äôre a well funded but early stage startup, so are looking for engineers who are excited about helping us shape the product, the culture and the business.    Martin was the technical founder at Unacast, where he developed an unnatural love for massive datasets, and is an active open source contributor. Dan has lent his skills to scaling data orientated startups with lofty ambitions; from eliminating food waste to giving people ownership of their personal data. Marcelo has brought to Alvin his 7 (SEVEN!) GCP certifications, regular blog posting, and extensive experience taming metadata in the wild. Oisin gave up his West Coat life in San Jose to come build Alvin with us in the Baltics. So far, no regrets. We aim to be a highly skilled and diverse team of 20 by the end of ‚Äò21.

Full-time",Associate,"Who We Are  Cimpress Technology develops cutting-edge, best-in-world software that our mass customization businesses use to create personalized products for over 17 million global customers. Our Mass Customization Platform is comprised of modular, multi-tenant services. Our businesses can choose the solutions that work for them, or assemble any custom combination they need. This makes it easier and faster to do things like introduce new products, reach customers and track orders. And this kind of innovation keeps customers coming back. Just last year, Cimpress generated $2.88B in revenue through customized print products, signage, apparel, packaging and more.  We encourage our engineers to think like an owner ‚Äì to continue to act small as we grow. Every team defines their own roadmaps, and uses the programming languages and technologies that suit them best. This helps us have a big impact at the enterprise level while still feeling small and nimble.  We are searching for an upbeat, self-motivated Data Analyst/Engineer with deep technical, analytical, organizational, and collaboration skills to work in our Shipping Technology software services group.  You are comfortable in a constantly evolving environment, taking on new and diverse responsibilities based on the needs of the business. You are self-directed with a strong bias for action who takes accountability for your performance and are comfortable working independently or on cross-functional, global teams.       At Cimpress, we value the experiences that individual team members add to our culture. Please don't hesitate to apply even if you don't meet the exact qualifications, we look forward to learning more about you!        Being at Cimpress means that you don‚Äôt see work as just a building, a desk or a manufacturing floor. You see it as a chance to take a step forward in your career journey ‚Äì and your life. We strive to give you everything you need to learn, grow, and succeed. Through innovation, collaboration, and perpetual exposure to what‚Äôs next, we‚Äôre always pushing boundaries and broadening our horizons. We embrace the chance to operate outside of our comfort zone to discover what we‚Äôre capable of. Some might call that a challenge; we just call it another great day at work.    In 2020, Vistaprint adopted a Remote-First operating model and culture. We heard from our team members that having the freedom, autonomy and trust in each other to work from home and, the ability to operate when they are most productive, empowers them to be their best. Vistaprint also provides collaboration spaces for team members to work physically together when it's safe to do so and when in-person collaboration will deliver the best results. Currently we are enabled to hire remote team members in over 30 US States as well as several countries in Europe, including Spain, Germany, UK, Czech Republic, the Netherlands and Switzerland.    Led by founder and CEO Robert Keane, Cimpress invests in and helps build customer-focused, entrepreneurial mass customization businesses. Through the personalized physical (and digital) products these companies create, we empower over 17 million global customers to make an impression. Last year, Cimpress generated $2.88B in revenue through customized print products, signage, apparel, packaging and more. The Cimpress family includes a dynamic, international group of businesses and central teams, all working to solve problems, build businesses, innovate and improve.    Cimpress Tech, a Cimpress company, is an Equal Employment Opportunity Employer. All qualified candidates will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, sex, national or ethnic origin, nationality, age, religion, citizenship, disability, medical condition, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender presentation, legal or preferred name, marital status, pregnancy, family structure, veteran status or any other basis protected by human rights laws or regulations.

Full-time",Mid-Senior level,"¬øQui√©nes somos?  Somos Holaluz y nacimos para hacer del mundo, un lugar mejor para todxs. ¬øQuieres saber c√≥mo? En este v√≠deo te lo cuenta Carlota Pi, una de las tres fundadoras de Holaluz.  T√∫ y el planeta sois lo que nos mueve a ser como somos y a hacer lo que hacemos. Uno de nuestros principales valores es #AlwaysPeopleFirst. Por eso, te proponemos seguir creciendo en un entorno donde el #HaveFun y el #KeepRowing son imprescindibles, pero en el que puedas tambi√©n desarrollarte 360¬∫.  Nuestra voluntad de hacer las cosas de un modo distinto, nos ha llevado a liderar la transformaci√≥n del sector el√©ctrico y a ser la primera el√©ctrica en obtener el certificado BCorp. En Holaluz  Llevamos una d√©cada revolucionando el sector de la energ√≠a el√©ctrica. De hecho, estamos transformando los metros cuadrados de los tejados de nuestras ciudades y pueblos en energ√≠a 100% verde para todxs. Y lo hemos llamado la Revoluci√≥n de los Tejados.  Nuestra misi√≥n no es otra que conectar a todas las personas a la energ√≠a 100% verde y no pararemos hasta conseguirlo.  ¬øTe sumas?    El foco del d√≠a a d√≠a est√° puesto en la resoluci√≥n de problemas a partir de los datos. El c√≥mo es secundario, se puede escoger cu√°l es la manera de llegar al resultado que aporte m√°s valor.  Desde el equipo de Business Intelligence de Holaluz ayudamos a los diferentes equipos de negocio a tomar mejores decisiones mediante insights, dashboards, alertas y modelos estad√≠sticos. Para nosotrxs es fundamental conocer bien los procesos y tener una buena comunicaci√≥n para aportar el m√°ximo valor posible con los datos.  Tendr√°s la misi√≥n de usar los datos para mejorar la vida del equipo de finanzas. Deber√°s proponer proyectos que ayuden a generar valor, automatizar informes y hacer forecasts. Crear√°s modelos para, por ejemplo, hacer una previsi√≥n de gastos, o detectar problemas antes que sucedan. Programar√°s ETL para modelar y cargar los datos en el Data Warehouse para que pueda ser explotada de la mejor forma.  El equipo es reactivo y activo. Es decir, los proyectos no s√≥lo se generan a partir de las necesidades comunicadas por las stakeholders, sino que tambi√©n se puede y es necesario que las personas del equipo propongan proyectos de valor, gracias a su visi√≥n transversal de la compa√±√≠a y su habilidad de trabajar con grandes vol√∫menes de datos.  Aunque hay la libertad de usar diferentes herramientas para generar valor, la arquitectura del equipo est√° basada en AWS. Gracias a un ETL basado en Pentaho Kettle y scripts en Python (algunos en spark) se integra toda la informaci√≥n interna y externa en nuestro Data Warehouse relacional, aunque estamos implementando un Data Warehouse columnar. No hay ninguna barrera para integrar datos las fuentes pueden ser desde typeforms hasta GA. Usamos Power BI y Board como herramientas de visualizaci√≥n, aunque para comunicar los insights a los stakeholders usamos las herramientas con las que estamos m√°s c√≥modxs.  Desde el equipo de Business Intelligence no entendemos nuestro d√≠a a d√≠a sin la innovaci√≥n. Buscamos cada momento nuevas formas de aportar valor, ya sea a los clientes como a los otros equipos.  ¬°Todo son retos en Holaluz ahora mismo!  Y como #SayThingsAsTheyAre es uno de nuestros valores, queremos ser claros y transparentes en explicarte qu√© har√°s durante tus primeros 6 meses en Holaluz.  En 1 mes...  Despu√©s del primer mes ya sabr√°s c√≥mo est√° todo montado, te habr√°s empapado de nuestra cultura y visi√≥n, te habr√°s reunido con todos los equipos y sabr√°s qu√© es lo que hacen y qu√© necesitan.  Empezar√°s a proporcionar las primeras tareas al equipo y conocer√°s las estructuras de las bases de datos de Holaluz. Tambi√©n conocer√°s tus principales stakeholders y c√≥mo t√∫ los puede ayudar con soluciones basadas en data.  Te habr√°s ido a comer alg√∫n d√≠a con las personas del equipo, habr√°s asistido a alguna formaci√≥n de equipo y hasta alg√∫n team building interno.  En 3 meses...  Seguro que ya habr√°s tomado muchas decisiones sobre c√≥mo aportar valor en tu equipo y estar√°s trabajando codo a codo con tus colegas, en otras palabras, habr√°s visto la LUZ.  Estar√°s gestionando las reuniones con los stakeholders y trasladando los retos y tus aportaciones al equipo.  Tendr√°s el suficiente conocimiento como para proponer nuevas soluciones para los equipos y estar√°s liderando un proyecto end-to-end.  En 6 meses...  Tendr√°s (casi) todo bajo control y habr√°s contribuido en la madurez y crecimiento de tu equipo. Habr√°s aportado valor m√°s all√° de tu equipo compartiendo conocimiento, y haciendo valer toda tu experiencia para mejorar el √°rea de Business Intelligence en finanzas.  Tendr√°s la responsabilidad de proporcionar los mejores insights a los stakeholders, recogiendo sus necesidades y evaluando su impacto.  Adem√°s, habr√°s tenido varias reuniones con tu responsable para saber c√≥mo te sientes en tus primeros meses con Holaluz.    Otro de nuestros valores es #KeepRowing o seguir remando, lo que significa que el trabajo en equipo y la alineaci√≥n del mismo es fundamental para poder avanzar y hacer frente a nuestros objetivos compartidos.  En Holaluz hemos construido un sistema organizativo robusto y en constante iteraci√≥n, que permite adaptarnos a los cambios constantes que exige el sector y a conseguir el prop√≥sito que perseguimos, utilizando diversas metodolog√≠as, entre ellas SCRUM. En Holaluz las reuniones y decisiones se hacen de forma colaborativa, el feedback fluye ü§ü entre los diferentes equipos y se promueve el apoyo entre las personas.    #AlwaysPeopleFirst y #HaveFun son tambi√©n valores muy importantes en Holaluz, y para pas√°rselo bien es importante tener un buen equipo de trabajo, por eso te presentamos a las personas con las que trabajar√°s en tu d√≠a a d√≠a.  Somos un equipo de 4 personas con un ambiente inmejorable.. Somos Manel, Roger, Ignasi y Edu tenemos muchas ganas de aprender nuevas formas de analizar los datos, pero tambi√©n hacemos algunas actividades de equipo dentro o fuera de la oficina! Te presento a tus compa√±eros üòÅ    Otra forma de #KeepRowing es remar todos juntos en perfecta sincronizaci√≥n y hacia un objetivo com√∫n, y qu√© mejor lugar para hacerlo que en nuestras oficinas de Barcelona a s√≥lo 200 metros del mar üåä. Esta excepcional ubicaci√≥n al lado de la playa es perfecta para hacer un con chapuz√≥n y poder poner en pr√°ctica otro de nuestros valores #HaveFun.

Apostamos por la individualidad y la flexibilidad poniendo a las personas en el centro de nuestras decisiones, es por eso que nuestras oficinas est√°n abiertas para aquellxs que lo necesiten o les apetezca trabajar en ellas. Estamos trabajando el flexible seating en la oficina y habilitando taquillas individuales para todxs, a la vez que estamos equiparando todas las salas de reuniones para poder hacer mejores v√≠deo-conferencias y que sigamos trabajando lo m√°s c√≥modxs posible desde casa o desde la oficina. Nuestra gente es lo m√°s importante, por lo que en la oficina debemos de cumplir los siguientes acuerdos     Hemos pensado muy muy bien lo que buscamos y lo que de verdad importa  Todo suma, as√≠ que si tienes alguna de estas cosas SUMA Y SIGUE       Otro de los valores que nos caracteriza en Holaluz es #EsPosible. Por ello, ofrecemos una serie de medidas para que puedas desarrollarte 360¬∫ y conseguir todo aquello que te propongas, tanto a nivel personal como profesional.

Our more than 95,000 people in more than 1,000 locations in 70 countries serve the local, regional and global real estate needs of those clients, growing our company in the process.  The individual Tetris country businesses have grown particularly strong business relationships with Corporate Solutions/Tenant Representation, Flex, Hotel, Retailer and landlord and investor clients; however many relationships/projects are ‚Äòone-off‚Äôs‚Äô and there is limited resource focused on gaining more market share within the EMEA region from these existing clients.  Additionally, with fee compression on transactional work, our EMEA JLL business partners are becoming more supportive of embracing and promoting Tetris services to their clients.  Tetris has grown substantially in the past 9 years and in 2020 delivered circa $ 700m in gross turnover. Given the impact on re-imagining assets, buildings and workplace(s) of the world, Tetris has an aggressive 2021 target now that Corporate Occupiers are beginning to determine how they will best use their workspaces in the future, and what needs to be done to make them future proof.  With the regionalisation of Tetris finalised, and Design Studio firmly within the Tetris businesses, we now wish to build on and leverage on individual/country successes with clients who operate in the EMEA region, as well as create a methodical BD/Sales strategy for targeting and growth in the EMEA region for 2021 and beyond.  This role is focused on identifying and winning new Corporate (Tenant) work across EMEA. This role is fundamental to developing/delivering new and additional turnover growth to meet targets for 2021 and beyond.

The Client Development (BD) Director will also be responsible for creating revenues across EMEA from existing client relationships, as well as supporting key pitches and tenders.  Tetris is seen to be a ‚Äòreceiver‚Äô of business within JLL; this role has a dimension of change management, in other words, creating meaningful cross-selling opportunities to other JLL business lines in order to change the perception/value of Tetris within the EMEA business. This can also create referral fee opportunities.

Pair programming, weekly demos, tech talks, and quarterly hackathons are at the core of how we‚Äôve built our team and product. We believe in engaging with the community, regularly hosting free events with some of the top technical speakers, and actively contributing to open source software. Our technology spans across web, mobile, API, big data, machine learning, search, physical point of sale, and scanning systems.

You will solve challenging technical problems and own your impactful products end-to-end.

At Eventbrite, we strive to support our Britelings and their loved ones through different stages of life with robust and attractive benefits, financial and physical wellness options, and great perks.  In addition to offering a competitive salary and company stock, we have other great benefits available.

We offer unlimited access to courses in Udemy, language exchange programs, internal training, Briteling talks, workshops and weekly sessions with our CEO    Our employees can choose what works best for them: work in one of our offices, be fully remote or the best of both worlds! We believe in a flexible working environment to allow Britelings to perform at their best ensuring a healthy work-life balance. We have recently implemented Britebreak Fridays: all Britelings turn off their computers and take the first Friday of every month off to focus on their wellbeing.

Full-time",Entry level,"We are happy that you are considering applying!  Tip: As the first step is just about submitting your resume, we suggest you carefully review the requirements below, and update your resume to best reflect how your profile fits the role.  Good luck!    At Sunday we are creating the future of payments, and are looking for experienced back-end and/or front-end developers.  With steady growth, millions of requests to handle, a rich and complex business domain and the need for us to have a very high level of availability, you'll find a rewarding and supportive work environment at Sunday.  We are searching for developers who understand that development is a team effort, who are proud of a job well done and know how to implement simple solutions to solve complex problems.    You don't have to be a ""fullstack"" developer to apply to Sunday. If you have an interest for back-end, front-end development (or both), we are interested in having a discussion.  Our teams work from the user interface, to the deployment units, owning the whole technology stack. We have a combination of backend, front-end and SRE working collaboratively. So, when needed, it will be expected of you to help your colleagues even if it is not in your area of expertise.    On the front-end part, we are using React for both Web & Mobile (React Native) applications. Our APIs are a mix of web sockets and classic rest interface. We are considering the use of the firebase solution for new features in the application.  On the backend, we have an existing software written in Python (with Flask) but we are migrating to a java 16 (with some parts in nodejs) based platforms.  For our persistence we are using mainly postgresql, but we also have some redis servers and a big query data store for analytics purposes.  Our monitoring is handled through datadog, and all of this is hosted on the GCP platform.    If you have already worked on software related to payment, restaurants or POS systems your experience will be of great interest to us.  In the same way, if you have notable experience in high performance, high availability, distributed architecture we would love to hear from you.  We expect our developers to know how to unit test their code, to write easy to read & maintain code and to be comfortable doing pair programming with her/his colleagues.    A learning environment with supportive colleagues, a place to grow both technically and as an individual.  A position with full flexibility: full remote, partial or in office as long as you are available on the CEST schedule.  Competitive salary (from 45 to 55 for junior dev, to 70-80 for senior one) and stock options.  100% health coverage for you and equal parental leave policy    Our first challenge is the need to interact with many different POS vendors, each with their specificity.  In addition we obviously must ensure a high level of security, great performance and availability.  Our rapid growth requires a strong focus on software architecture to sustain our delivery capacity while increasing our teams' size, adding new features to the existing software and handling an ever-rising number of users.  And at last, the type of industry we are serving implies a sudden and concentrated traffic peak, meaning we need to have an on-demand scaling capability.    #HexagonalArchitecture, #DDD, #TDD, #PairProgramming, #ReactiveArchitecture, #Java16, #PostgreSQL, #React, #NodeJs, #GCP, #Redis, #CI/CD, #Git"

For those who make or use music, we allow them to plug in to our O.S. to ease operations, increase earnings, and get in sync with everyone else.    BMAT started in 2005 when a group of engineers with a passion for music decided to spin-off from an audio research lab in Barcelona. We‚Äôre now over 160 people, spread across Barcelona, Buenos Aires, Lima, Rio de Janeiro, London, Paris, Nairobi, Oslo, Tel-Aviv, Singapore, Tokyo, Manila, Bangkok and Lagos.  We‚Äôre a team of pretty decent people who enjoy working with each other. We‚Äôre open-minded and well-traveled, coming from all parts of the world. We‚Äôve got rappers, producers, cello players, DJs, and songwriters. The passion for music, the excitement for innovative technology and Barcelona as a backdrop has proven to make a good combination.  Join us from wherever you are on our mission to help make music live forever.  We say there‚Äôs a BMAT touch. We believe it has to do with being passionate, obsessive, nice, generous, honest, self-motivated, entrepreneurial, intrepid, crazy, extraordinary, creative, agile, human, friendly, smart, witty, talented, naive, optimistic, surprising, sensual, and nerdy, but not very hipster (unfortunately). Our way of being is always sprinkled with transparency, perseverance, flexibility, open-mindedness and trustworthiness.    In our Recordings team at BMAT, we are responsible for recording more than 7000 channels worldwide in order to feed our real time music monitoring platform (Vericast). To do so, we have deployed more than 250 recording servers all over the world to get even the most remote regional channel. As the platform keeps growing we need to tackle new challenges and evolve the systems to ensure top notch performance and quality.  Your responsibilities will be to help us design, develop and maintain the evolution of the current system that will push the recording team to the next level.  It is a challenging and ambitious project surrounded by a young and enthusiastic team.    We are looking for a problem solving team player who is capable of learning about new technologies and sharing the passion the same way as we do.  You will be responsible for designing, developing and maintaining a platform to deal with all the recording process -catching multiple TV and Radio signals, process and upload them to our centralized platform, process all the data (task queue involved) and distribute the results..  If you are an open minded person who thinks ahead and considers the bigger picture don‚Äôt hesitate to apply!"

Our more than 95,000 people in more than 1,000 locations in 70 countries serve the local, regional and global real estate needs of those clients, growing our company in the process.  The individual Tetris country businesses have grown particularly strong business relationships with Corporate Solutions/Tenant Representation, Flex, Hotel, Retailer and landlord and investor clients; however many relationships/projects are ‚Äòone-off‚Äôs‚Äô and there is limited resource focused on gaining more market share within the EMEA region from these existing clients.  Additionally, with fee compression on transactional work, our EMEA JLL business partners are becoming more supportive of embracing and promoting Tetris services to their clients.  Tetris has grown substantially in the past 9 years and in 2020 delivered circa $ 700m in gross turnover. Given the impact on re-imagining assets, buildings and workplace(s) of the world, Tetris has an aggressive 2021 target now that Corporate Occupiers are beginning to determine how they will best use their workspaces in the future, and what needs to be done to make them future proof.  With the regionalisation of Tetris finalised, and Design Studio firmly within the Tetris businesses, we now wish to build on and leverage on individual/country successes with clients who operate in the EMEA region, as well as create a methodical BD/Sales strategy for targeting and growth in the EMEA region for 2021 and beyond.  This role is focused on identifying and winning new Corporate (Tenant) work across EMEA. This role is fundamental to developing/delivering new and additional turnover growth to meet targets for 2021 and beyond.  The Client Development (BD) Director will ‚Äòown‚Äô and be evaluated on the delivery of revenue targets, pipeline, use of sales tools (Salesforce), tactics, goals as measured by (e.g. revenue, new meetings, pitches), ‚Äòfunnel‚Äô evolution and all other elements of sales management. The Client Development (BD) Director will also be responsible for creating revenues across EMEA from existing client relationships, as well as supporting key pitches and tenders.  Tetris is seen to be a ‚Äòreceiver‚Äô of business within JLL; this role has a dimension of change management, in other words, creating meaningful cross-selling opportunities to other JLL business lines in order to change the perception/value of Tetris within the EMEA business.

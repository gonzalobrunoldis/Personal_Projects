Division Responsibilities
IHPA’s vision is for all Australians to have access to a sustainable, locally controlled health
system that funds public hospital and aged care services using activity-based funding, where
practicable, based on a national efficient price.
In the context of public hospitals, IHPA's primary function is to calculate and deliver an
annual National Efficient Price (NEP). The NEP is a major determinant of the level of
Australian Government funding for public hospital services and provides a price signal or
benchmark for the efficient cost of providing public hospital services. We undertake several
major areas of work designed to inform the annual determination of the NEP, including
ongoing consultation with all Australian health departments, expert advisory committees
and key stakeholders.
In the response to the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety, the
Commonwealth Government announced that IHPA’s functions will be expanded to include
providing advice to the Commonwealth Minister for Health and Aged Care on aged care
pricing matters.
This will require IHPA to undertake costing studies, develop and refine classification systems
and develop pricing models, in close consultation with a wide range of stakeholders.
Branch Responsibilities
The Pricing and Analytics Branch is responsible for the development and evaluation of
national cost and pricing models for public hospitals and aged care services. The Branch
undertakes analysis to contribute to the understanding and communication of key trends in
activity and cost data used by IHPA, and utilises a combination of traditional statistical
modelling and machine learning to develop pricing models used to determine funding for
public hospitals and aged care providers.

Ensure that all new business projects take account of data needs, ensure that data definitions and data flows are documented, and play a role in project requirements and project testing to ensure that everything that needs to be tracked is tracked, controlled and surfaced.
Over time, help to evolve our analytics practices from being descriptive to being predictive & prescriptive, including helping to develop data science experiments and models.
Develop and manage other data pipelines as required by other parts of the business, eg product reference data ingestion.
